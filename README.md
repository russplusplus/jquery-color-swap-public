# JQuery Color Swap

This project was an individual in-class assignment built in about 90 minutes to test our familiarity with JQuery.

## Description

The initial page displays just a button that generates a new div element, with a red background. The user can generate as many of these as he/she wishes. Each of these elements has a button that turns its background yellow. The new, yellow element has a button that changes its background to a randomly selected-color and generates another randomly-selected color change button.  

## Technologies Used

The app uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript with JQuery. DOM elements are targeted with JQuery by their class, and css styles are applied to these classes.
